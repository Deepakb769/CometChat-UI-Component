COMETCHAT-UI-COMPONENT FEEDBACK

Overview
CometChat’s UI Components provide a modular and flexible way to build a chat application. Instead of using a full pre-built interface, developers can import only the components they need—such as ConversationList, MessageList, MessageComposer, etc.—and customize the layout and styles to match their app’s branding.

This approach offers a great balance between flexibility and functionality, especially for developers who want more control without writing chat logic from scratch.


Pros / Advantages

1. Modular & Customizable:

* You can pick and choose components based on your app's needs.
* Customize the layout, style, or even behavior without losing CometChat’s built-in functionality.

2. Built-in Chat Logic:

* Each component comes with its own internal chat handling, like fetching messages, sending messages, typing indicators, and more.
* No need to manually write SDK logic — the components are ready to use out of the box.

3. Quick Integration:

* Great for mid-level developers who want chat features without relying entirely on pre-built UI kits.
* Faster to get started than working with the SDK alone.

4. Design Flexibility:

* Ideal if you want to follow your app’s custom design language.
* Allows seamless integration with other custom UI or third-party components.

5. Reduced Boilerplate:

* No need to deal with state management or repetitive SDK calls — the components manage data flow internally.


Cons / Drawbacks

1. Styling Limitations:

* While customization is possible, the components come with default styles that can sometimes be difficult to override completely without digging into the source or using complex overrides.

2. Layout Complexity:

* Assembling the chat interface manually requires a good understanding of component composition and layout logic (e.g., wrapping views, flex arrangements).
* Beginners may find it slightly overwhelming compared to the Visual Builder or Pre-Assembled UI Kit.

3. Limited Extensibility in Some Components:

* Certain UI components have limited customization options for deeper UI changes (e.g., changing internal structure or adding new props).
* You may eventually need to fall back on the SDK for highly custom behavior.

4. Incomplete Control in Logic Handling:

* Since the logic is built-in, you may run into scenarios where you can’t easily modify how messages are fetched, stored, or rendered without overriding or rewriting parts of the component.

5. Documentation Depth:

* Some components lack detailed customization guides or examples in the official documentation, requiring extra trial and error or support queries.
